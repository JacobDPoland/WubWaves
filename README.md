# WubWaves
Wavey and circular audio visualizer with dynamic coloring based on emotional sentiment analysis
## TODO:
1. Make a flask app
2. Connect Spotify account using their API
3. Get current song's lyrics (use lyric api if necessary)
4. Use lyrics and expert.ai to get song's sentiment
5. Apply color mapping to visualization based on sentiment
6. Include simple Spotify controller if possible (previous, skip, pause/play, volume)
