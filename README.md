### TODO:
* download .mp3 file from user-provided YouTube URL (be sure to delete this file either after playing or on exit)
* get lyrics to the specified song from a lyrics API such as TheAudioDB
* Analyze sentiment based on lyrics by querying Google's Natural Language API
* map good/bad/neutral sentiment to a color palette spectrum (hue rotation?)
* play .mp3 file while using CodingTrain's fft visualization
* customize visualization using sentimental color palette
